This past weekend we were given the opportunity to design a mobile application for an organization or of an idea that created by one of the design alumni. 

Not only was it our first experience (at least for me, others may have designed apps before) designing on a mobile app platform, but it was also our first time creating as part of a team with another designer in our class. 

##The Idea
Our alumna, Carissa, came up with the idea of "The Kindness Project", an organization dedicated to improving the world around us and reuniting humanity through daily acts of kindness. She wanted was a social media-based platform that was centered around the idea of being able to "challenge" others into performing random acts of kindness.

##The Design
Carissa was extremely open to how we would approach achieving such an app, which had both its perks and its set backs. Having more structure would have narrowed down our focus to what the client wanted done specifically, ultimately saving a lot of time. However, having such a broad platform allowed us to be creative with the project and implement a lot of our own personal ideas of what would make this app viable and useful. In the end, we decided on an app geared towards sending, accepting, and sharing “challenges” that prompt others to go out and commit certain random acts of kindness. The following is a summary of our design: 

###Main Pages
* New Member Sign Up/Current Member Log In Page
* Newsfeed (Home) Page
* Challenges Pages  
   * View Challenges
   * Send Challenges
   * Completed Challenges
* Profile Page
* Menu Page  
   * Home
   * Challenges
   * Profile
   * Sign out

###User Flow
1. The user receives an invite from a friend via Facebook or Twitter, announcing the challenge they have waiting for them.
2. Through the message, they are redirected to download the app.
3. Once the app is opened, they are given the choice to either sign up via Facebook
or Twitter, or through their email address.
4. Once logged in, they can accept the challenge their friend has given them on the
“View Challenges” page.
5. Once the challenge is accepted and completed, the user can post to their newsfeed
a message about the kindness act they performed, the location where they
performed it, and any related pictures they have.
6. After successfully posting to the newsfeed, the user is alerted that they have been
awarded 3 challenges that they can now assign to friends.
7. Through the “Send Challenges” page, they are able to send a personalized random
act of kindness challenge to 3 friends via Facebook, Twitter, text message, email,
or by searching for other users on the app.
8. They also are able to see how many people their acts of kindness have influenced
and affected on the “Challenges” main page.
9. At any given time, the user can sign out through the Menu page.

##What I Learned
Um.... A LOT?? Not only did I learn various design elements and tools with creating an app, but I also gained a lot of experience in voicing and defending my design ideas with a fellow designer, as well as what it's like to pitch an idea to a client. I typically can present myself well through written words, but when it comes to communicating in person I tend to get jumbled up on my thoughts and which words I should use in order to successfully get my message through to the receiving end. I learned that along with much of life, confidence is key. As long as you have the knowledge to back your ideas the words will eventually fall into place. Thinking and gathering my thoughts before speaking is a must.

I also gained experience dealing with proportions of mockups in comparison to what will actually display on screen. It was definitely interesting learning that I was struggling with designing things in the right proportions considering my art (photorealism portraits) excels in proportions and is the main reason I've been recognized in the art world (that and my insane attention to detail, which I touched on the negative affects it has on my web design in my first blog post). I think ultimately it comes down to how I've been so used to drawing true-to-size; I draw from printed out photos and create a drawing of the same scale. When I first started drawing I didn't draw to scale, but it's been so long since I've practiced working that way that I realized I've somewhat lost touch with the ability to see and then recreate at any size. Having the ability to zoom in and out on a computer screen is definitely a perk, but its something I need to be mindful about to ensure I don't make things too large.

Lastly, I just wanted to note that I am amazed by how much I am learning while in this course. Going into this I had no idea I would be capable of thinking/creating such a wide range of designs and then having the ability to actually implement them across so many different mediums. I knew that the curriculum built on each other each week, but the flow of everything has surprisingly been presented in a way that I've understood easily. Coming from absolutely no background in web design, I'm pretty proud of where I am thus far. Granted I know I still have a long way to go, but I'm excited for this new journey and all of the opportunities that will come with it.
