Here's an inside look into my experience applying for jobs as a newcomer in the tech community, plus some helpful tips I've learned along the way for others in the same position.

First of all, let me start off with saying that as much as I love being a part-time commission artist, at times it can be extremely frustrating. Especially since the holidays are my busiest season and it has kept me from being able to apply to jobs. So, after almost 2 months since graduating from The Iron Yard, I've finally begun my journey on the much anticipated (and dreaded) job seeking adventure.

Being that I am so new to this industry, there are a lot of factors that go into this whole job process that I find to be either interesting, terrifying, or both.

## Online Appearance/Involvement in Tech Community

### Twitter

Having a Twitter account and active involvement on there is crucial, especially amongst the tech community. 

Currently, I have 2 posts and roughly around 4 followers. I literally joined Twitter for the sole purpose of increasing my chances of getting a job. It's not that I was ever opposed to it, it's just up until now Instagram has been the primary social media platform I use (and quite successfully might I add) since it helps showcase and promote my art. 

The problem with having recently joined Twitter and being so knew to it is that I have no clue how to go about making myself an "active user". So until I actually start using it, I honestly feel that having my account linked to my portfolio will do more damage than good. 

Hopefully now that I don't have to juggle finishing my portfolio (which I'll talk about later) alongside doing all my holiday drawings, I'll finally have the time to figure it out and can start being considered a cool kid on Twitter. 

### Dribbble

Same goes for Dribbble, except I'm actually beyond super stoked about getting involved on there. 

I never knew about Dribbble until being in the course and I'm so glad that they introduced me to it. One of the things I have enjoyed the most about attending The Iron Yard was becoming a master at using Adobe Illustrator. I've always had an extreme appreciation and interest in mixed-media art and now I have the tools to create it and a place for me to display it.

Even though my classmates and instructor have told me I should post my art on there, I've avoided doing so. I really want to use Dribbble for the sole purpose of showcasing my illustrations and what I can create digitally - which currently I don't have much of. The one illustration I've posted so far of my elephant logo (which I drew then scanned into Illustrator) has had a pretty great reaction from the Dribbble community, and for me being such a new user has been super encouraging. 

Once I get more applications filled out and have more free time, I'm pumped at getting to make more and start blowing up Dribbble with all of my awesome creations. I feel like this is where I'm going to shine when it comes to online involvement in the tech community.

### Meetups

One of the most crucial factors that plays into getting hired as a UI/UX designer is knowing people who already work in the industry and getting your name out there. 

A great way to go about doing this is to start attending meetups. Austin has an awesome meetup scene and groups to join/events to go to can easily be found at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/). My favorite meetup that I would HIGHLY recommend checking out is the Refresh Austin group. They have a lot of great speakers that hit on a wide range of topics pertaining to the tech industry.

Not only will you get to meet a lot of great people and make a lot of helpful connections at meetups, you can also ask questions and gain insight from people there that you otherwise probably wouldn't be able to. 

As long as you are outgoing enough to approach them and comfortable enough to admit that you're new here, they will be more than happy to help out in any way they can. It's probably one of my favorite parts about embarking into the world of tech: although its super intimidating, everyone really is looking out for each other and wanting everyone to succeed. 

## The Portfolio

Next up, having a sound portfolio. 

The whole process of designing and creating a portfolio is a complicated one. There are so many factors that go into making a good portfolio and knowing the significance it plays in getting hired can be overwhelming, especially if you're new to the industry like myself. 

First of all, the portfolio itself is an example of what you're capable of doing so when designing it you want it to be a direct reflection of your skills as a designer. However, with that being said, when potential employers are reviewing your portfolio they'll also be looking at a billion others. You'll want it to be to the point/simple enough that it is easy to maneuver, yet still make an impression on those looking at it. 

I actually struggled a lot with this and making sure not to over design my site. I spoke with a lot of people at meetups and got a lot of mixed answers on how much design attributes a portfolio should possess. Ultimately what I took away from everyone is just sticking true to yourself, because in the end it is a representation of who you are as a person and as a designer. 

By creating a portfolio with a lot of design elements to it may have been the riskier move for me to take, but by doing so I am more confident about employers viewing it. I feel like after seeing it they'll have a better idea of what to expect if they were to hire me. 

Also, I made sure on my individual project pages to focus the attention heavily towards my process. I've learned that employers care about HOW you go about making something just as much as WHAT you actually make. They can go and see the final product of my projects elsewhere, but what they can't see is what it took to get me there. By explaining your process it gives them a better idea of what it would be like working/collaborating on projects with you if they were to hire you.

It's definitely super frustrating not being able to apply for jobs until you have a great portfolio, but once you're finally finished with it (or at least to the point that you don't completely hate it) and are able to start submitting it to places, it's a pretty amazing feeling. 

## Cover Letters

Or in other words, a place to show you actually care and to let your personality shine.

Cover letters for my previous jobs were an insignificant thing with the sole purpose of giving employers a briefing on my qualifications without having to look through my entire resume. But in the tech field, cover letters are super important. 

Apparently for a lot of companies they'll either start considering you or completely disregard you all together just from reading your cover letter. This is where you let them know who you are as a person, why you're interested in their company, and why you more than anyone else applying for the position are a good fit for the job.

Cover letters should be personal, not general. Which means for every place you apply to you need to do your research on the company and let it show through your cover letters. Being passionate about what the company is doing and being a good fit/compatible with its current team is one of the most important things for me personally in my job hunt. Despite my desperation for a job, I won't take a position with a company, or even apply to one, unless I know I'd actually enjoy working there. Through researching a company's website and getting to know them more, you not only are able explain yourself better in your cover letter, but you'll also figure out whether or not you should be applying there in the first place.

Is it super time consuming trying to figure out who specifically to personalize your cover letter to? Yes. But it's totally worth the time it takes to creep through their entire website/Linked profiles to show them that little extra and that you actually care.

## The Interviewing Process

No matter what job you are applying for, the interview is always the most stressful part. Being a new member to the tech industry makes the interview process ESPECIALLY intimidating.

Back when I used to apply for jobs in child care, I literally OWNED all my interviews. Being that I'm a talker/people person and because I was extremely confident and knowledgeable of anything to do with kids, I absolutely loved being interviewed. I knew that no matter what question they threw at me, I had a super awesome answer to throw right back. But now... ah geeze I couldn't be more terrified.

Despite having being so late in the game to start applying, I actually received my first call back just 2 days after submitting my application. Although it was nice having that quick of a turn around (which is extremely uncommon), I was definitely caught off guard and unprepared for the initial phone interview that came with that call. Two things you should be prepared to answer prior to applying: what your favorite thing is/what you enjoy doing the most pertaining to UI/UX design, and what your preferred salary is. Seems pretty standard, but regardless I wish I had thought of this a head of time. Now it's a waiting game, with hopes of hearing back to set up an in-person interview. 

As of right now, I don't have much feedback to give on this, but once I do I'll give a play by play of what I went through and what you can expect. I can tell you this much: checking your email every day and having zero responses is discouraging, but DON'T GIVE UP! Companies are literally reviewing an insane amount of applications and it takes them a while to get back to those they are interested in. Just be patient and give it time. In the meanwhile, write more awesome blog posts :)
