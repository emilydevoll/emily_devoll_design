		    <p>CSS Zen Garden is a website that tests a UI designer's skills in using CSS/SASS by providing their HTML framework, but only allowing designers to manipulate the CSS in the constructing of the website's design. Designers can view what other people have created on <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">the website</a> and they can post their own once they've finished designing it.</p>

		    <p>For this project, everyone in my class was assigned an art movement and were required to design the CSS Zen Garden site based on our given theme. I was assigned the De Stijl art movement. </p>

		<h3>Research</h3>

		<p>Our research requirements consisted of looking into our themes history, learning more about the design elements that it encompasses, and then presenting to our class what we found and how we planned on implementing them into our designs. I decided to focus my attention towards Piet Mondrian who was one of the major influences during that time and whose work still holds relevance today.</p>

		<p>When I found out that I had De Stijl, I was a bit worried at first that I would be able to pull it off. While I'm known to make adventurous choices in my color palettes, the movement consists of precisely rendered geometric forms, usually in straight lines, squares, and rectangles that are in primary colors. Ultimately through researching the simplicity of this movement and creating a design to reflect it, it taught me how to use more control in my designs.</p>

		<p>This was the first time I actually spent a great deal of time looking into what other designers have created through perusing previous submissions on the site. Up until that point I had honestly thought that by looking into what others are already doing on the web and implementing features I liked into my own designs was considered cheating. This was the beginning of my realization that if it's already been done and done well, I'm capable of creating something exactly like it if not better.</p>

	    <h3>The Design</h3>

		    <a href="../images/css-zen-header.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/css-zen-header.jpg"></a>
		    <a href="../images/css-zen-body.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/css-zen-body.jpg"></a>
	    </div>

	    <p>The color selection was intended to reflect one of Mondrian's most popular artworks, <span>Composition A</span>, but with a more vintage feel through using faded versions of the loud red, blue, and yellow he uses in his piece. 

	    <p>Through the use of Adobe Illustrator, I created my own versions of De Stijl art for the header and main body background images which were the elements I centered the sit's design around. I continued the art movement theme through creating every section and div on the site to resemble the De Stijl squares in order to appear as if they were a part of the art on the background images. I used CSS3 animations on the links to the site's featured design examples with the intent on making them appear as if they were moving. Wasn't very successful at that, but regardless I am happy with how they turned out and still think they fit well in with my art movement theme.</p>

	  	<p>I used the sans-serif Montserrat Subrayada for all of headers (main headers in bold) due to how its underline decoration resembled the lines used in creating De Stijl art. I paired it with the serif font Roboto Slab for its more traditional style to reflect the time period the movement occurred. I also used an accent font, Open Sans Bold (another sans-serif) for all of the links located out of the main text area. I did this in order to designate a difference between the two, since the outside links to take you to other parts of the website, while the inside links connect you to the tools needed for participating in the site's CSS design challenge.

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>We were given this assignment during our third week of school, so naturally it came with a lot of challenges. We had just learned about web design fundamentals the week before so it was only our second time to create and code our own designs. Coding was still so extremely new to me at that point and the inability to alter the HTML content on the website complicated things further. And then on top of it all, as part of our project's requirements we had to implement CSS3 animations and make them supported across all browsers, all of which we learned in only a day literally the day before.</p>

		<p>Being that I had never used Adobe Illustrator before until on this project, a lot of my time was spent trying to figure out how to even use the thing. Because I hadn't discovered the marvels of the pen tool yet, I was using the line and rectangle tools to create my background images. Here's a fun fact about using the line tool: when saving the images for web, the lines have to be 100% perfectly straight or else they will create kinks in the line that won't appear until on the save for web screen. The amount of time I spent trying to get rid of those kinks was depressing, mostly in part from me making the rookie mistake of not saving my progress as I worked. After two straight days of trying to make those lines absolutely perfect, Illustrator crashed on me and I lost everything. Luckily I had saved numerous versions as images, however, at that time I still hadn't fully got the hang of optimizing images so every image is either blurry or has kinks in the lines somewhere. I now save as frequently on Adobe Suite as I do when I code, plus I have auto save set up so this never happens to me again. Considering I could probalby draw those images in my sleep now, I'll eventually redo them so I can finally submit my design to CSS Zen Garden. </p>
