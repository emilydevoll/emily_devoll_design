		    <p>CSS Zen Garden is a website that tests a UI designer's skills in using CSS/SASS by providing the HTML framework and content for their site, but only allowing designers to manipulate the CSS in the construction of the website's design. Designers can view what other people have created on the website and they can post their own once they've finished designing it. You can visit the actual site <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">here.</a></p>

		    <p>For this project, everyone in my class at The Iron Yard was assigned a specific art movement and were required to design the CSS Zen Garden site based on our given theme. My art movement was De Stijl. Every page is responsive, so no matter what size screen the user is viewing it on they will receive the same experience as they would on a desktop.</p>

	   	<p>For the initial design process, my partner and I drew up sketches and then I implemented them into wireframes using Adobe Illustrator. The design direction we went in was based on the theme of uniting the world through helping others and putting the "human" back into humanity. </p>

	    <p>The color selection was intended to reflect the blues and greens of Earth, but with a twist in order to provide a greater distinction between colors for hierarchal purposes and for a more calming experience for the user. We included yellow and coral for our "call to action colors" due to their contrast against existing colors without being too assertive.</p>

	  	<p>The headers are in Sofia Pro Bold while the main text is in Visby Medium. Both are sans-serifs fonts and were selected for their modern yet comforting appearance due to their rounded lines. The organization's name was used in the cursive typeface Pacifico for it's distinction against the rest of the fonts and for it's friendly and fun appearance.

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>The main challenge I faced was with this assignment being only the second project where we were in charge of creating the design. Coding was still so very new to me at this point and the inability to change any of the HTML content on the website complicated things further. And then on top of it all, as part of our project's requirements we had to implement CSS3 animations and make them supported across all browsers, all of which we had learned just the day before.</p>
