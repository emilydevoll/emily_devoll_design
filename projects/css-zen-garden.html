		    <p>CSS Zen Garden is a website that tests a UI designer's skills in using CSS/SASS by providing the HTML framework and content for their site, but only allowing designers to manipulate the CSS in the construction of the website's design. Designers can view what other people have created on the website and they can post their own once they've finished designing it. You can visit the actual site <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">here.</a></p>

		    <p>For this project, everyone in my class at The Iron Yard was assigned a specific art movement and were then required to design the CSS Zen Garden site based on our given theme. My art movement was De Stijl.</p>
