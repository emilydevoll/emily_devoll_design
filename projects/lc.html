						<h3 class="c_title_st">MY ROLE</h3>
						<p class="c_content_st">As a design consultant, I worked alongside the
                                client to establish the company’s brand through
                                logo creation, developing a color scheme, and
                                aiding in name development. </p>

                                design foundation needed to start turning their

				<p class="c_content_st">With a background in backend engineering, he knew exactly what the industry was missing and
                        the kind of company it needed. Creating that company’s voice and design direction was a different
                        story and he was in need of some guidance.</p>

                            <h2 class="c_title_st">DESIGN</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">We started out by listing the desired attributes his company would have that set it apart from the
                                    rest. He knew it needed to center around the importance of education and the bond that forms
                                    from mentorship, plus highlight the eclectic atmosphere of being a hip, modern and genuinely fun
                                    place to thrive. </p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">To assist in landing on a company name, I created a lengthy word list consisting of various words
                                    associated with his interests that he wanted incorporated into the company: space, geometric
                                    shapes, and precious gemstones.</p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">With his vision set, we both created mood boards with various themes that could reflect the over
                                    all voice he was aiming to achieve. From there I created different color swatches inspired by those
                                    themes, resulting in a palette of cool and tranquil colors.</p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">For the logo he only had one requirement: there needed to be an ornate version that could easily
                                    transfer to a monochromatic version. Inspired by Saturn’s moon Rhea and the cut of a round
                                    gemstone, I combined their elements to create a logo that’s truly out of this world.</p>

                            <h2 class="c_title_st">MERCH</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">My favorite part of this whole experience was having Lunar Collective’s logo turned into company
                                    swag! Not only are the perks of seeing the logo on different mediums and getting to wear my
                                    design pretty awesome, but I’ve loved watching how they use it in different creative ways.</p>
