	    <p>Texas A&M University’s 12th Man Foundation is a dual service that includes the athletics department donor program and the university’s athletic matches and events ticketing provider. Our role was to redesign their current website and create a pairing app for Aggie fans to buy and manage their season tickets, athletic department donations and 12th Man Foundation member account.</p>

	    <h3>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
	    <p>A lot of our attention was surrounding establishing the product strategy and doing a thorough breakdown of the information architecture. Considering the client already had a website built that received a high level of traffic on a daily basis, it was crutial that we devise a way from them to maneuver the site easier without having to drastically change their already current behavior patterns.</p>

	    <p>We conducted rounds of user interviews where we tested not only the current site’s flow, but also numerous prototypes of different versions of the website’s redesign that featured different approaches to organizing the information architecture, as well as prototypes of the new mobile application. From our findings we were able to assess their pain points and implement their feedback into the overall flow and functionality of the website and mobile app.</p>

	    <h3>Design</h3>
	    <p>One of the major components was for the design direction to be cohesive with the client’s current brand. We conducted numerous mood boarding exercises as a team and with the client that would be used and reflected throughout the website and accompanying mobile app. The exercises included various approaches, each with distinctly different points of view and direction in mind.</p>

		<h3>Challenges</h3>

		<p>The major challenge faced during this project was establishing the information architecture for the website and how to best reflect everything (features, flow, etc.) through the accompanying app. Since the website contained a heavy load of information and features, it was our job to filter through everything and create a hierarchy of features that focused on what was most important to the users and then organize it in a way that made it easier for them to access.</p>
