	    <p>Goodreads is an interactive website that provides the ability to: keep track of books read, progress on books currently reading, store books to read in the future, rate and review books, receive book recommendations, and share/interact with other users.</p>

	    <p>The site is known for having a lot of content and features that isn't really designed or organized as well as it could be. Our assignment was to redesign and create mockups for the "my books", newsfeed, and profile pages on the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads' website.</a></p>

		<h3>Research</h3>

		</div>

		<p>One of the main components of this assignment was to conduct research that was geared towards figuring out how to redesign the site according to the current users' needs. In order to do this, I conducted interviews with current and new users to investigate what the positive and negative aspects are of the site from their point of view. I was then able to narrow down my findings into what features/issues I needed to focus on based on frequently occurring comments from the interviewees.</p>

		<h4>Questions/Actions Asked:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Join the site if not already a member.</li>
			<li>Explore/perform functions on the site as they normally would.</li>
			<li>While exploring, comment on experience/overall opinion.
				<ul>
					<li>What do you like?</li>
					<li>What do you not like?</li>
					<li>What common frustrations do you run into?</li>
					<li>What would you change about the site?</li>
				</ul>
			<li>What features do you use most/find most important?</li>
			<li>What features do you use the least/find least important?</li>

		</ul>
		<h4>Findings:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Initial web design is too cluttered/busy.</li>
			<li>New users were unsure/confused about how to use any of the special features.</li>
			<li>The overall color scheme is boring (monotone).</li>
			<li>Menu icons are hard to see/use.</li>
			<li>Overall site is hard to navigate due to poor hierarchy.</li>
		</ul>
				
		<p>I then broke down all of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that the current site has to further aid my design.</p>

		<p>Through creating a wordlist, I listed various words that my mind connects to the website into categories (people, places, things, adjectives, and colors) and from there I was able to group together similar words to form my possible design themes.</p>

	    <h3>The Design</h3>
	    <div class="parent-container">
	     	<a href="../images/style-tile1.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/style-tile1.jpg"></a>
		    <a href="../images/style-tile2.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/style-tile2.jpg"></a>
		   
		    <a href="../images/style-tile3.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/style-tile3.jpg"></a>
	    </div>

	    <p>From my wordslist, I created 3 distinct possible style tile themes for my design. First style tile was designed to encompass the idea of reading by a window, or how books are the window to the soul. The second style tile was geared towards a more traditional approach with a masculine vibe, focusing on worn leather books and the warm colors found in old libraries. The theme was based on the idea that books take you on adventures to explore unknown lands. The style tile I decided to go with based on feedback from fellow classmates was based book modification art and how books are in black and white but their stories are the colors that bring it to life.</p>

	    <p>Using Adobe Illustrator I created a logo for each theme to encompass the direction I was going for and was used as the center for each design. The logo of the design I went in was created to resemble the imagination coming out from a book.</p>

	  	<p>I used the serif font Arapey for all of headers (subheaders in italics) for its resemblance to the typeface typically found in books but with a more playful vibe in order to reflect the theme. I paired it with the sans-serif font Open Sans Regular for its more modern style and good contrast against Arapey.

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>The primary challenge I faced was centered around figuring out how to best organize all of Goodreads' content, without having to get rid of any of their features. It was through my user interview findings that I was able to focus my attention on the necessities first, and then focus on ways to include the less used features second. By doing it this way I was able to break down the possible ways to organize the pages much easier.</p>
