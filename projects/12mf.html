            <p class="c_content_st">Texas A&M University’s 12th Man Foundation is their organization that allows fans to become
                    contributing members in making donations to Aggie student athletes, as well as purchase tickets
                    for upcoming athletic events.</p>

                    <h3 class="c_title_st">MY ROLE</h3>
                    <p class="c_content_st">As a member of the design team, I worked
                            alongside the client to recreate the website’s
                            information architecture and conduct research,
                            but focusing mainly on the app’s ticketing flow.</p>

                    <h3 class="c_title_st">THE CHALLENGE</h3>
                    <p class="c_content_st">Redesign A&M’s current website and create a
                            pairing app for 12th Man Foundation members to
                            easily buy and manage their season tickets, make
                            donations, and view articles.</p>

            <h2 class="c_title_st">THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <p class="c_content_st dash_st_2">The 12th Man Foundation had an outdated website that needed redesigning and
                    restructuring after many years of receiving complaints from members being unable to
                    easily find what they are looking for on the site.</p>
            <p class="c_content_st">Currently the only way Texas A&M fans can purchase tickets to sporting events is through the 12th
                    Man Foundation’s confusing website. Plus their tickets had to be printed or mailed to them in order
                    to get into the game. They need a way to easily purchase and access their tickets, make donations
                    to support student athletes, and read up on what’s going on in Aggie Land.</p>

                            <h2 class="c_title_st">RESEARCH</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">We conducted numerous interviews with current members to assess what major pain points they
                                    experienced with the current website’s infrastructure. After regrouping, we tested prototypes of the
                                    website’s redesign that featured different approaches to organizing the information architecture.
                                    We also conducted A/B testing with prototypes featuring various ticketing flows for the mobile app.</p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">From the findings we were able to implement their feedback into the overall flow and functionality
                                    of the website and mobile app.</p>

                            <h2 class="c_title_st">DESIGN</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">One of the major components was for the design direction to be cohesive with the client’s well
                                    established brand. We conducted numerous mood boarding exercises as a team and with the
                                    client to brainstorm various approaches, each with distinctly different design directions.</p>
