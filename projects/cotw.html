            <p class="c_content_st">Call Tuner is a powerful new tool for hunter that allows them to practice and perfect making
                    animal calls through listening to their sounds, recording themselves imitating what they hear, and
                    comparing their frequencies to the real animal’s call.</p>

                    <p class="c_content_st">As lead designer I was responsible for conducting
                            user interviews, making high fidelity mock ups and
                            prototypes, while being a main point of contact for
                            the client in making their vision is a success.</p>

                    <p class="c_content_st">Modernizing the animal call learning experience
                            while bridging the inefficiencies between hunters
                            and the outdated calling tools currently available.</p>

            <h2 class="c_title_st">THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <p class="c_content_st dash_st_2">At the time, the call tuning apps only played animal calls and none of them had a learning
                    system in place. The closest thing available using frequencies was a set of costly CDs that
                    you installed on a computer. </p>
            <p class="c_content_st">All animals speak to each other on specific frequencies - similar to radio stations. Hunters need a
                    lot of practice to build up their abilities necessary for animals to believe their calls. The equipment
                    used to record the animal’s frequency is bulky and not accessible to majority of the public, thus a
                    smaller mobile version that’s easily available to the masses is needed.

                            <h2 class="c_title_st">RESEARCH</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">I conducted two rounds of user user interviews. The first round focused on gathering information
                                    from hunters regarding their current patterns (what works/what doesn’t work) when learning
                                    animal calls. Since there wasn’t any direct competitors on the market, I had the opportunity to
                                    create a tool uniquely tailored to meet the needs of hunters from all experience levels.</p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">During the second wave of user testing, I provided participants with a high fidelity prototype in
                                    order to test the app’s functionality and the hunter’s ability to successfully use its features. Since
                                    there were so many unknown variables when creating the prototype, I was able to gather my
                                    findings and make any necessary changes before launching the app. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content padding_35">
                            <h2 class="c_title_st">DESIGN</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">Since the client hadn’t created a brand yet, I was given the opportunity to work alongside her and
                                    assist in establishing one.</p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">We wanted to create a masculine tone specifically with the hunter in mind. The design aesthetic
                                    pulls from colors and textures inspired by nature and is intended to resemble signs hunters see
                                    while they are out on a hunt. </p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">The overall layout needed to be easy to understand and presented in a way that would be familiar
                                    to our older audience. With that in mind, for any feature considered more advanced I included
                                    simple on boarding screens that instructed users on how to user them.</p>
