				<h2 class="c_title_st">INTRODUCTION</h2>
				<p class="c_content_st">Autopet’s Litter-Robot is the highest rated, WiFi-enabled, automatic, self-cleaning litter box for cats.
						You never have to scoop cat litter again, all while giving your kitty a clean bed of litter for each use.</p>

						<h3 class="c_title_st">MY ROLE</h3>
						<p class="c_content_st">As lead designer I was responsible for making
								high fidelity mock ups and prototypes. I played the
								pivotal role in earning the client’s trust in order for
								necessary improvements to be made.</p>

						<h3 class="c_title_st">THE CHALLENGE</h3>
						<p class="c_content_st">Create a way that gives people freedom from their
								litter box duties by allowing them to view waste
								drawer levels, get notifications, troubleshoot, and
								see recent usage history for insights into their cat's
								health - all from their phone.</p>

				<h2 class="c_title_st">THE PROBLEM</h2>
				<p class="c_content_st dash_st_2">Initially the client mainly wanted our developers to finish where their previous developer left
						off. Problem was, there wasn’t a designer involved when they first started and the original
						developer didn’t have any design experience. The client needed convincing to re-evaluate
						adding more design into their forecast. </p>
				<p class="c_content_st">Cat owners rejoiced when an automated litter box was released, but they still were unable to track
						usage, know when to empty the waste bin, or receive notifications if an error occurred unless they
						were home to check. They needed a way to keep up to date no matter where they are.</p>

						<h2 class="c_title_st">THE DESIGN</h2>
						<p class="c_content_st">I started out by altering only the most dire design needs that would result in the least amount of
								additional work for the developers. After presenting the changes and explaining the impact they
								would have, the client liked the improvements so much that they decided to increase allocations
								for design by an additional 2 months.</p>
						<p class="c_content_st">The design is clean, light and playful, as well as maintaining a minimalistic flow. The color scheme
								and font selection were changed to reflect their brand, where as previously there was no continuity.</p>
						<p class="c_content_st">My absolute favorite part about working on this project was getting to create the custom
								illustrations and animations. The client liked the cat so much that they centered their marketing
								videos around them and broadcasted them at CES. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="content padding_35">
						<h2 class="c_title_st">CES 2017</h2>
						<p class="c_content_st">One of the greatest opportunities I’ve had to date was getting to join the Autopets team at the 2017
								Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. While there I got to help pitch their latest
								Litter Robot model by presenting the new accompanying app I designed to people all over the
								world. It allowed me to test my abilities to present to an audience, even when there is a language
								barrier present.</p>
