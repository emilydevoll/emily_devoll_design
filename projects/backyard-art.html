    <p>For my final project at The Iron Yard, I created a web application called Backyard Art: a website made by an Austin artist, for Austin artists and art lovers.</p>

    <p>The site is centered around the issue that even though Austin is so geared around "keeping it local", there aren't many online resources for Austin artists. More specifically, there currently isn't anything available that allows local artists to show and sell their work, as well as provide them a means to see what other artist's in town are creating in order to either gain inspiration or reach out to them for collaboration purposes.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Backyard Art does all of this, plus has an all inclusive calendar of all the art events occurring in Austin, including: festival dates and submission deadlines, art exhibit and gallery openings, art related meetups, classes, and so much more. Plus the entire site is responsive so the user gets the same experience no matter what size screen they are on.</p>

    <h3>My Research</h3>

    <p>The research I conducted for this assignment consisted of a SWOT analysis, user personas, word list, and user interviews.</p>

    <p>The SWOT analysis broke down all of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that my site would have. I really wanted to focus not only on current aspects of the site, but more importantly on future possibilities and features it could have if it were to continue beyond being just my final project.</p>

    <p>The user personas were created to help give me better sense of the target audience I was making my site for and the possible characteristics and interests that they would have. I really wanted to hone in on three main audiences: people interested in the site for buying art, artists that are recent Austin transplants and are wanting to get involved in the art community, and artists that are struggling to get their art seen and sold.</p>

    <p>I decided to create a word list as part of my research in order to assist in creating my design direction. Through compiling various relating words into categories (people, places, things, adjectives, and colors) I was able to group together like words to form my potential design themes.</p>

    <p>The user interviews I conducted were with potential users that were both artists and art buyers. Through their responses I was able to optimize my page layouts and search options to better accommodate their needs.</p>

    <p>I also researched the structure of other art sites in regards to sorting and displaying a lot of images/art. One of the biggest challenges I faced was with </p>

    <h3>The Design</h3>
  	<div class="parent-container">
  		<a href="../images/backyard-sketch.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/backyard-sketch.png"></a>
	    <a href="../images/all_wireframes2.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/all_wireframes2.jpg"></a>
	    <a href="../images/all_style_tiles.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/all_style_tiles.jpg"></a>
	   <!--  <a href="../images/profile1.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/profile1.png"></a> -->
    </div>
    <p>For the initial design process, I drew up sketches of each page for small, medium, and large screen sizes then I implemented them into wireframes using Adobe Illustrator.</p> 
    
    <p>The design direction I decided to go in was based off of my first style tile which is centered around the idea of how the world is viewed in black and white but art is the pop of color that brings it to life. For an overview of all my style tile themes, visit my <a href="https://github.com/emilydevoll/backyard_art/blob/gh-pages/style_tiles/style_tile_concepts.md">concepts page.</a></p>

    <p>One of the challenges I faced when creating my color palette was that I wanted it to be reflective of my "pop of color vs. black and white" theme, yet not detract any attention from the most important elements on the page: the art. I decided on using only one color, a vibrant blue/turquoise that I pulled from the background image on the homepage, and used it sparingly on only the most important text or as an accent color in order to draw just enough attention.</p>

    <p>The background images were taken by Louis Lander Deacon (Imagine Dragons' <span>Head Me</span> album cover photographer) and were chosen for their beauty and relevance to the website name being that they are images of art occurring outdoors. Through the use of animation I switched between black and white to colored versions of 3 photos from his collection to correlate my design theme.</p>

  	<p>I selected Oswald Regular for my headers due to its modern sans-serif appearance and for its eligibility on images when used in all uppercase. I paired it with another modern sans-serif, Poppins Light, due to its more rounded edges and contrast next to Oswald's more angular features.

    <p>Through use of Adobe Illustrator, I created a logo for my site, as well as icons for three reoccurring meetups on my events calendar.</p>

    <p>The logo was created to symbolize the art factor through an artist's beret, and represent Austin by using a cut out of the shape of Texas and a mustache since facial hair is a very common feature amongst males living here.</p>

    <p>For the Lifedrawing meetup I decided to reenact an actual life drawing by creating a simple sketch/outline of a female figure. With sketch bomb I took their name literally by using pencils as if they were TNT. Being that I attend the Art Attacks Austin meetup, I tried to encompass their fun and quirky audience through making a colorful warrior unicorn whose horn is "attacking" Austin.</p>
