	<h1>Backyard Art</h1>
  	<h2>Responsive, Web Design</h2>

	    <p>Backyard Art is a web application I created for my final project at The Iron Yard. It is a site made by an Austin artist and is geared towards other artists/art lovers living in Austin. </p>
	    <!-- <p>For my final project at The Iron Yard, I created a web application called Backyard Art: a site made by an Austin artist that is geared towards other artists and art lovers living in Austin.</p> -->

	    <p>The site is centered around the issue that even though Austin is so geared around "keeping it local", there aren't many online resources for Austin artists. More specifically, there currently isn't anything available that allows local artists to show and sell their work, as well as provide them a means to see what other artist's in town are creating in order to either gain inspiration or reach out to them for collaboration purposes.</p>

	    </div>
	    <p>Backyard Art does all of this, plus has an all inclusive calendar of every art event occurring in Austin, including: festival dates and submission deadlines, art exhibit and gallery openings, art related meetups, classes, and so much more. Every page is responsive, so no matter what size screen the user is viewing it on they will receive the same experience as they would on a desktop. Everything on the site was created through the use of HTML5, SCSS, and jQuery plugins.</p>

	    <h3>My Research</h3>
	    <div class="parent-container2">

		    <a href="../images/backyard-swot1.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/backyard-swot1.png"></a>
		    <a href="../images/backyard-wordlist.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/backyard-wordlist.png"></a>
	    </div>
	    <p> I started my research by conducting interviews with potential users of the site that were both artists and art buyers. Through their responses I was able to have a better understanding of what features the site should have. I also researched the structure of other art sites in regards to sorting and displaying a lot of art images. By combining those results I was able to optimize the page layouts and search options to better accommodate the users needs. </p>

	    <p>I created user personas to help give me better sense of my target audience and the characteristics/interests that they would have. I really wanted to hone in on three main audiences: artists that are struggling to get their art seen and sold, people interested in buying art from local artists, and artists that are recent Austin transplants and are wanting to get involved in the art community.</p>

	    <p>Then I made a SWOT analysis where I broke down all of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that my site would have. I really wanted to focus not only on current aspects of the site, but more importantly on future possibilities and features it could have if it were to continue beyond being just my final project.</p>

	    <p>Making wordlists is a huge part of my research process in creating a design direction. Through compiling various words that my mind connects to the website into categories (people, places, things, adjectives, and colors) I'm able to group together similar words to form my possible design themes.</p>

	    <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was finding a calendar tool. Knowing that it was one of the main features on my site, it was crucial for it to allow a lot of content to be inputted, display that content in an aesthetically pleasing way, all the while being able functionality and run smoothly. I decided to go with UpTo for it's responsive design and easy usage and site maneuverability through being able to be embedded directly into my HTML code as an iframe.</p>

	    <h3>The Design</h3>
	  	<div class="parent-container">
	  		<a href="../images/backyard-sketch.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/backyard-sketch.png"></a>
		    <a href="../images/all_wireframes2.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/all_wireframes2.jpg"></a>
		    <a href="../images/all_style_tiles.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/all_style_tiles.jpg"></a>
	    </div>
	    <p>For the initial design process, I drew up sketches of each page for small, medium, and large screen sizes then I implemented them into wireframes using Adobe Illustrator.</p> 
	    
	    <p>The design direction I decided to go in was based off of my first style tile which is centered around the idea of how the world is viewed in black and white but art is the pop of color that brings it to life. For an overview of all my style tile themes, visit my <a href="https://github.com/emilydevoll/backyard_art/blob/gh-pages/style_tiles/style_tile_concepts.md">style tile concepts page.</a></p>

	    <p>The background images were taken by Louis Lander Deacon (Imagine Dragons' <span>Head Me</span> album cover photographer) and were chosen for their beauty and relevance to the website's name due to being taken outdoors. Through the use of CSS animation I switched between black and white to colored versions of 3 photos from his collection to correlate with my design theme.</p>

	    <p>A challenge I faced when creating my color palette was that I wanted it to reflect my "pop of color vs. black and white" theme, yet not detract any attention from the most important elements on the page: the art. I decided on using only one color, a vibrant blue/turquoise that I pulled from the background image on the homepage, and used it sparingly on only the most important text or as an accent color in order to draw just enough attention.</p>

	  	<p>I selected Oswald Regular for my headers due to its modern sans-serif appearance and for its eligibility on images when used in all uppercase. I paired it with another modern sans-serif, Poppins Light, for its more rounded edges and contrast next to Oswald's more angular features.   
	  	</p>

	  	<div class="parent-container3">
	    	<a href="../images/directory.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/directory.png"></a>
	    	<a href="../images/artists-page.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/artists-page.png"></a>
	    	<a href="../images/events.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/events.png"></a>
	    </div>

	  	<p>It was important to me that all of the content on the site be genuine to my concept. All of the art featured on the artist directory page is from actual Austin artists who I'm friends with on Instagram that gave me permission to use their art. The art featured Ramona Flowers' page is by my favorite artist, Steven Vigil, but since he doesn't live in Austin he agreed to letting me use a character from one of my favorite movies as the artist.</p>

	  	<p>The biggest challenges I faced were creating a grid layout on the artist's page and image optimization for all of the art photos. I wanted the layout to be clean and cohesive, but the images' different sizing made it difficult. One of the most important things when it comes to displaying art with the intention of selling it is that you DO NOT alter or crop the photos unless given permission by the artist. Image optimization was a challenge because I wanted the site to have a fast loading time and low data usage for the user, but at the same time I didn't want to reduce the art's quality and details in the photos. I overcame this by adjusting their sizing and resolution in Adobe Photoshop.</p>

	  <h3>Logo and Icons</h3>

	    </div>
	    <p>What I enjoyed most was using Adobe Illustrator to create a logo for my site and icons for three reoccurring meetups on my events calendar.</p>

	    <p>The logo was created to symbolize the art factor through an artist's beret, and represent Austin by using a cut out of the shape of Texas and a mustache since facial hair is a very common feature amongst males living here.</p>

	    <p>For the Lifedrawing meetup I decided to reenact an actual life drawing by creating a simple sketch/outline of a female figure. With sketch bomb I took their name literally by using pencils as if they were TNT. Being that I attend the Art Attacks Austin meetup, I tried to encompass their fun and quirky audience through making a colorful warrior unicorn whose horn is "attacking" Austin.</p>
