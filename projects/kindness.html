    <p>The Kindness Project is a hypothetical organization that was created by one of the Iron Yard's UI Design alumnae. One of the main components of this project was to gain experience working with a client and collaborating in teams.</p>
    <p>Our assignment was to create a mobile app with a social media based platform for the organization that allowed it's users to share their stories of random acts of kindness they've performed and challenge other users to do the same.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <p>The research I conducted for this assignment consisted of a SWOT analysis, user personas, and a word list.</p>
    <p>The SWOT analysis broke down all of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats which also consisted of a short overview of all the current competitors that related to different aspects of our app.</p>
    <p>The user personas were created to help give a better idea of who are target audience was and possible characteristics that they may have. A challenge I faced with creating these was that there potentially could have been a wide audience this app could be useful for, but for the purpose of our assignment we needed to narrow it down, resulting in the 16 to 30 age bracket.</p>
    <p>I decided to create a word list as part of my research in order to assist in creating our design direction. Through compiling various relating words into categories (people, places, things, adjectives, and colors) I was able to group together like words to form my potential design themes.</p>

    <h3>Our Design</h3>

    <p>For the initial design process, my partner and I drew up sketches and then I implemented them into wireframes using Adobe Illustrator. The design direction we went in was based on the theme of uniting the world through helping others and putting the "human" back into humanity. </p>

    <p>The color selection was intended to reflect the blues and greens of Earth, but with a twist in order to provide a greater distinction between colors for hierarchal purposes and for a more calming experience for the user. We included yellow and coral for our "call to action colors" due to their contrast against existing colors without being too assertive.</p>

  	<p>The headers are in Sofia Pro Bold while the main text is in Visby Medium. Both are sans-serifs fonts and were selected for their modern yet comforting appearance due to their rounded lines. The organization's name was used in the cursive typeface Pacifico for it's distinction against the rest of the fonts and for it's friendly and fun appearance.
