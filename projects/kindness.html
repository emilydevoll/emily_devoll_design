    <p>The Kindness Project is a hypothetical organization that was created by one of the Iron Yard's UI Design alumnae. One of the main components of this project was to gain experience working with a client and collaborating in teams.</p>
    <p>Our assignment was to create a mobile app with a social media based platform for the organization that allowed the user to share their stories of random acts of kindness they've performed and challenge other users to do the same.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <p>This past weekend we were given the opportunity to design an app of an organization or idea created by one of the design alumni. Not only was it our first experience (at least for me, others may have designed apps before) designing on a mobile app platform, but it was also our first time getting to create with another designer in the class, being that we were put into teams for the assignment.</p>

    <h3>Our Design</h3>
  	<div class="parent-container">
    <a href="../images/kindness_project_style_tile.jpg" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/kindness_project_style_tile.jpg"></a>
    <a href="../images/accept.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/accept.png"></a>
   <!--  <a href="../images/profile1.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/profile1.png"></a> -->
    </div>
    <p>The design direction we went in was based on the theme of uniting the world through helping others and putting the "human" back into humanity. The style tile provided was my initial design but changes were made for the final product.</p>

    <p>The color selection was intended to reflect the blues and greens of Earth, but with a twist in order to provide a greater distinction between colors for hierarchal purposes and for a more calming experience for the user. We included yellow and coral for our "call to action colors" due to their contrast against existing colors without being too assertive and still calming for the user.</p>

  	<p>The headers are in Sofia Pro Bold while the main text is in Visby Medium. Both are sans-serifs fonts and were selected for their modern yet comforting appearance due to their rounded lines. The organization's name was used in the cursive typeface Pacifico for it's distinction against the rest of the fonts and for it's friendly and fun appearance.
