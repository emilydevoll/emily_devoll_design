    <p>The Kindness Project is a hypothetical organization that was created by one of the Iron Yard's UI Design alumnae. One of the main components of this project was to gain experience working with a client and collaborating in teams.</p>
    <p>Our assignment was to create a mobile app with a social media based platform for the organization that allowed its users to share their stories of random acts of kindness they've performed and challenge other users to do the same.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    </div>
    <p>The research I conducted for this assignment consisted of a SWOT analysis, user personas, and a word list.</p>
    <p>The SWOT analysis broke down all of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats which also consisted of a short overview of all the current competitors that related to different aspects of our app.</p>
    
    <p>I decided to create a word list as part of my research in order to assist in creating our design direction. Through compiling various relating words into categories (people, places, things, adjectives, and colors) I was able to group together like words to form my potential design themes.</p>

    <h3>The Design</h3>

   <!--  <a href="../images/profile1.png" class="gallery-item"><img src="../images/profile1.png"></a> -->
    </div>
    <p>For the initial design process, my partner and I drew up sketches and then I implemented them into wireframes using Adobe Illustrator. The design direction we went in was based on the theme of uniting the world through helping others and putting the "human" back into humanity. </p>

    <p>The color selection was intended to reflect the blues and greens of Earth, but with a twist in order to provide a greater distinction between colors for hierarchal purposes and for a more calming experience for the user. We included yellow and coral for our "call to action colors" due to their contrast against existing colors without being too assertive.</p>

  	<p>The headers are in Sofia Pro Bold while the main text is in Visby Medium. Both are sans-serifs fonts and were selected for their modern yet comforting appearance due to their rounded lines. The organization's name was used in the cursive typeface Pacifico for its distinction against the rest of the fonts and for its friendly and fun appearance.

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p> A challenge I faced with this project was during the creation of our user personas. Considering the organization wasn't real, it was difficult for me designate a target audience and figure out their possible characteristics, especially since our alumna didn't know what direction she wanted it to go in. After discussing it with my partner and instructor, we decided to aim towards the 16 to 30 age bracket because we felt they would would be more likely to use the app and find it beneficial.</p>
    <p>The biggest challenge I faced was working with a partner on this project. I've worked in groups for the majority of my education and career, but this was the first time I was faced with having to voice my opinions and articulate my thoughts to someone with a strong vision and that has much more experience than me. It was extremely intimidating at first, but through trial and error I was able to figure out the best way to approach issues that would be most suited for his personality. Ultimately I am VERY thankful to have experienced this because it allowed me to gain more knowledge on how to handle certain situations when collaborating with other designers, and it also provided me the realization that I actually know a lot more about UI design than I thought.</p>

    <h3>InVision Prototype</h3>

    <iframe style="transform: scale(0.5)"  width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/ES4OPA0Y7" frameborder="0" ></iframe></div>
    <p>We used InVision for presenting our final project so that our alumna could view, use, and test it as if it was a functional web application. This was my first time using a prototyping tool overall I enjoyed my experience working with InVision. It make not have numerous customization features and options, but it makes up for it using a format that is relatively easy to learn and use.</p>
