    <p>The Kindness Project is a hypothetical organization that was created by one of the Iron Yard's UI Design alumnea. One of the main components of this project was to gain experience working with a client and colaborating in teams.</p>
    <p>Our assignment was to create a mobile app with a social media based platform for the organization that allowed the user to share their stories of random acts of kindness they've performed and challenge other users to do the same.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <p>The design direction we went in was based on the theme of uniting the world through helping others and putting the "human" back into humanity.</p>

    <p>This past weekend we were given the opportunity to design an app of an organization or idea created by one of the design alumni. Not only was it our first experience (at least for me, others may have designed apps before) designing on a mobile app platform, but it was also our first time getting to create with another designer in the class, being that we were put into teams for the assignment.</p>

  	<p>Our alumni, Carissa, came up with the idea of "The Kindness Project", an organization dedicated to improving the world around us and reuniting humanity through daily acts of kindness. She wanted was a social media based platform that was geared around the idea of being able to "challenge" others into performing random acts of kindness.
