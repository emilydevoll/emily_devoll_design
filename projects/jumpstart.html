                    you access to locations across Austin, so you never have to run out of battery again.</p>

                    <p class="c_content_st">As product design lead, I conducted the research
                            from start to finish by recruiting testers, creating
                            questionnaires, conducting interviews, analyzing/
                            presenting results through experience maps, and
                            producing high fidelity mock ups/prototypes all
                            while being a main point of contact for the client.</p>

                            phone by helping them locate the closest public
                            charging station and ensuring that it will be
                            available once they get there.</p>

            <h2 class="c_title_st">THE PROBLEM</h2>

            <p class="c_content_st">Dying phones are a problem that everyone deals with when they leave their charger at home.
                    Although there are some venues and businesses in Austin that offer people a way to charge up,
                    they require them to lock away their phones when they might need to use it most. Plus they have
                    no way of knowing if these charging lockers will have any availability, leaving them with a dead
                    phone while they wait for a spot to open up.

                            <h2 class="c_title_st">RESEARCH</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">Since we were working alongside a hardware team, I began researching what current competitors
                                    were doing successfully and what we could do differently to improve the experience.</p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">Once we decided on how the hardware would look and function, we created a prototype of the
                                    hardware to use for field testing. We set up the prototype at a bar on 6th Street to test how well
                                    people responded to it, as well as see how much they were willing to pay to charge by varying the
                                    price throughout the night.</p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">Lastly I created a prototype of the reservation flow to test how well users were able to maneuver
                                    through it. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content padding_35">
                            <h2 class="c_title_st">DESIGN</h2>
                            <p class="c_content_st">Based on the research findings, the key features we decided to focus on for V1 was the reservation
                                    feature. V2 would allow users to view a venue’s events and specials, plus have the option to
                                    upgrade their charging experience by paying a small fee for a faster charge. </p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">Since the target audience is late night bar attendees, I went with a dark color scheme so that it
                                    would be easier on their eyes in darker settings. I also provided users the ability to lower the screen
                                    brightness in order to conserve battery while using the app. </p>
                            <p class="c_content_st">In case their phone is about to die, users are able to text a code to a friend for them to unlock their
                                    reservation for them. The friend can then unlock the reserved port by entering in the code they
                                    received via the “Unlock Reservation” option in the settings menu.</p>
